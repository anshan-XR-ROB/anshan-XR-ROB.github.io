Dr. Shan An received a Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering from Tianjin University, China in 2007 and a Master's degree in Control Science from Shandong University, China in 2010. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Beihang University in 2022. He currently leads the XR-ROB Lab at Tianjin University, focusing on dexterous manipulation and extended robotics reality. He is an IET Fellow and a BCS Fellow. He is also a senior member of IEEE and a member of ACM. He has authored or co-authored more than 60 papers in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. He holds 70 patents in China and 9 patents in the United States, Japan, and Russia. He has served as a program committee member for ACM Multimedia (2019-2022), AAAI (2022-2023), and IJCAI (2021-2024). He has served as a reviewer for more than 40 prestigious journals and conferences, such as T-PAMI, T-IP, T-MI, T-MM, T-NNLS, RA-L, ICRA, and IROS.

Current Research Interests
======
1. Embodied Intelligence and Robotic Dexterous Manipulation 
Focusing on how robots interact with environments through hands, arms, and sensors to achieve dexterous, precise, and stable manipulation tasks via integrated perception-decision-control loops. Emphasis on imitation learning methods with applications in industrial, agricultural, and service robotics.
2. Extended Robotics Reality 
Leveraging Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) technologies to extend perception and control capabilities between humans and robots, as well as between robots and environments. Research directions include teleoperation, digital twins, and immersive human-robot interaction, serving as crucial enablers for remote collaboration and human-robot integration.
3. Robotic Vision 
Exploring how robots understand environments through visual perception to support navigation, object recognition, grasping, and manipulation. Research encompasses multimodal visual fusion, object detection and tracking, pose estimation, and visual representation learning, forming the foundational perceptual capabilities for autonomous intelligent behaviors.

To Prospective Students
======
We are seeking passionate PhD or Master's students in robotics, computer vision, or machine learning to research and develop state-of-the-art technologies for extended reality and robotic dexterous manipulation, aiming to create practical intelligent systems for real-world applications.
